TechDig​​ital6 – Full Scope Security Audit Report
Date: July 28, 2025
Auditor: Seb Singh, Cybersecurity Engineer
Company: TechDigital6
Audit Type: Full-Spectrum Security Posture Evaluation
Scope: Internal & External Systems, Applications, Network, Policies, Access Control

1. 🔍 Executive Summary
This security audit assesses the current cybersecurity posture of TechDigital6, a mid-sized digital services firm. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate current controls, and recommend improvements to mitigate potential threats across the network infrastructure, system architecture, access control mechanisms, application layers, and organizational policies.
⚠️ Overall Risk Posture: Moderate-High
🔒 Key Concern: Lack of centralized access control and external-facing unpatched services.

2. 🏗️ Infrastructure & Network Architecture
2.1 Network Mapping & Segmentation
VLANs used for separating internal departments: ✅
No segmentation between staging and production environments: ❌
Public IPs exposed for internal tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab): ❌

2.2 Firewall & Perimeter Defense
Edge firewall: Fortinet (NGFW) with outdated firmware: ❌
Default deny rules not enforced: ❌
Ingress ports open: 22 (SSH), 80, 443, 8080, 3000
Unused ports (e.g., 3389, 5900) left open: ❌

2.3 VPN & Remote Access
VPN enforced via OpenVPN with certificate-based auth: ✅
No MFA configured on VPN: ❌
Split tunneling enabled: ❌

2.4 Recommendations
Patch firewall firmware immediately.
Enforce network segmentation between environments.
Audit and close unused ports (3389, 5900).
Enable MFA for VPN users.







3. 🖥️ Server & Endpoint Hardening
3.1 Operating Systems
Mixed OS landscape: Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu 20.04
No standard hardening baseline applied: ❌
Windows SMBv1 still enabled: ❌
3.2 Endpoint Protection
Antivirus: Windows Defender + CrowdStrike Falcon (partial deployment)
No endpoint detection on legacy MacBooks (HR/Marketing): ❌
3.3 Patch Management
Linux servers patched monthly via cron script: ✅
Windows updates delayed for "compatibility": ❌
3.4 Recommendations
Disable SMBv1 across all Windows hosts.
Apply CIS or STIG baseline hardening.
Extend EDR coverage to all endpoints.

4. 🔐 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
4.1 Authentication
Internal systems use LDAP without TLS encryption: ❌
SaaS services (e.g., Google Workspace, Salesforce) secured with SSO: ✅
Shared root/admin credentials found in DevOps team: ❌
4.2 Authorization
RBAC implemented only on cloud dashboard: ❌
No least-privilege enforcement on AWS IAM policies: ❌
4.3 Account Lifecycle
Former employees still have active credentials (2 of 15): ❌
No automated de-provisioning process: ❌
4.4 Recommendations
Encrypt LDAP authentication (LDAPS).
Enforce password rotation and eliminate shared accounts.
Audit IAM roles and enable least privilege on cloud resources.


5. 🧱 Web Applications & APIs
5.1 Web Applications (Customer Portal, Internal CRM)
No WAF in place for production portal: ❌
Internal CRM allows admin page access without auth token: ❌
Input fields not sanitized – potential for XSS and SQL injection: ❌

5.2 APIs
Public REST API lacks authentication for GET endpoints: ❌
No rate limiting or API gateway: ❌
Uses outdated JWT libraries (vulnerable to token forgery): ❌
5.3 Recommendations
Implement WAF with OWASP rule sets.
Sanitize all user inputs and use parameterized queries.
Migrate to updated JWT libraries and secure API endpoints with API keys and OAuth2.


6. 📜 Security Policies & Compliance
6.1 Policy Review
Acceptable Use Policy exists, but last updated in 2021: ❌
No documented Incident Response Plan: ❌
No annual cybersecurity awareness training: ❌
6.2 Compliance Alignment
Handles PII/financial data; no evidence of SOC 2 or ISO 27001 readiness: ❌
No logging or SIEM solution in place: ❌
6.3 Recommendations
Draft, review, and enforce the following policies:
Incident Response Plan
Disaster Recovery Plan
Access Management Policy
Implement ELK or Splunk-based SIEM.
Schedule mandatory annual cybersecurity training.
